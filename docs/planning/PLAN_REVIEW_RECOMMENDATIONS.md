2. **Human Preference:** +25.7% improvement (Table 3) ‚úÖ
3. **Diversity Retention:** 66.8% after alignment (Figure 4) ‚úÖ
4. **US States Demo:** KL=0.12 alignment (Figure 2) ‚úÖ
5. **Emergent Scaling:** Larger models benefit more (Figure 3e-f) ‚úÖ

### Additional Evidence Worth Highlighting
1. **Temperature Orthogonality** (Figure 5): VS works with temperature scaling
2. **Dialogue Simulation** (Figure 6): Compelling real-world application
3. **Open-ended QA** (Figure 7): Practical benefits for survey/QA tasks
4. **Synthetic Data Generation** (Table 4): 37.5% vs 32.8% math accuracy

## üéØ Recommendations for Plan Adjustments

### 1. Week 2 Timeline Optimization
Current Days 3-5 should focus on:

**Day 3: Copy Functionality & User Experience**
- Implement universal copy buttons (CRITICAL for adoption)
- Create enhanced recipe cards with parameters
- Add loading states and error boundaries

**Day 4: Additional Evidence & Polish**
- Temperature ablation interactive (Figure 5)
- Qualitative examples showcase (Table 2 stories)
- Model comparison table
- Performance optimization

**Day 5: Testing & Integration**
- Cross-browser testing
- Accessibility audit (WCAG AA)
- Mobile experience refinement
- Final content review

### 2. High-Priority Additions

#### Must Have (Before Launch)
1. **Copy buttons** on all code blocks and prompts
2. **Qualitative examples** from Table 2 (story diversity)
3. **"Quick Start" section** with immediate copy-paste prompts
4. **Social proof section** with human evaluation results

#### Nice to Have
1. **Temperature combination demo** showing orthogonal benefits
2. **Model selector** in playground for different LLMs
3. **Export functionality** for generated distributions
4. **Share buttons** for specific configurations

### 3. Content Structure Refinements

```markdown
Suggested Flow:
1. Hero: Visual comparison (Direct vs VS)
2. Quick Start: Copy-ready prompts (<30 seconds to try)
3. Why It Works: Typicality bias ‚Üí Mode collapse ‚Üí VS solution
4. Interactive Playground: Try with different thresholds
5. Evidence Dashboard: Key metrics at a glance
6. Deep Dive: Mathematical foundation (collapsible)
7. Applications: Creative, Dialogue, QA, Synthetic Data
8. Recipes: Progressive complexity (Standard ‚Üí CoT ‚Üí Multi)
9. FAQ & Troubleshooting
10. Citations & Resources
```

### 4. Technical Optimizations

1. **Performance:**
   - Lazy load heavy visualizations
   - Use React.memo for chart components
   - Implement virtual scrolling for long lists

2. **Accessibility:**
   - Keyboard navigation for all interactives
   - Screen reader descriptions for charts
   - High contrast mode support

3. **Analytics:**
   - Track playground interactions
   - Monitor copy button usage
   - Measure scroll depth and engagement

## üìà Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks & Mitigations
1. **Chart performance on mobile** ‚Üí Simplified mobile visualizations
2. **Complex math intimidating users** ‚Üí Progressive disclosure with "Show Math" toggles
3. **Too much content** ‚Üí Collapsible sections with smart defaults
4. **Browser compatibility** ‚Üí Fallback static images for unsupported browsers

## üöÄ Week 3-4 Adjustments

### Week 3: Polish & Testing
- User testing with 5+ readers from target audiences
- Performance optimization (target <3s load time)
- SEO optimization (meta tags, structured data)
- Create video demos for social media

### Week 4: Launch Preparation
- Deploy to production (Vercel recommended)
- Prepare launch assets:
  - Twitter/X thread
  - LinkedIn article
  - Reddit posts for r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA
  - HackerNews submission
- Set up monitoring and analytics
- Prepare follow-up content plan

## ‚ú® Key Success Factors

1. **Immediate Value:** Users can copy and use VS prompts within 30 seconds
2. **Clear Story:** Typicality bias ‚Üí Mode collapse ‚Üí VS solution
3. **Strong Evidence:** Multiple compelling visualizations and metrics
4. **Practical Applications:** Real-world use cases clearly demonstrated
5. **Progressive Complexity:** Simple start, detailed exploration available
