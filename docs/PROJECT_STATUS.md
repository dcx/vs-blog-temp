# Verbalized Sampling Blogpost - Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025
**Current Status:** Week 2, Day 3 Complete
**Live URL:** http://localhost:4321/

## 📊 Project Overview

An interactive academic blogpost that explains **Verbalized Sampling (VS)** - a training-free method to mitigate mode collapse in LLMs by prompting for probability distributions rather than single responses.

### Key Objectives
- Make VS intuitive and reproducible in ≤60 seconds
- Demonstrate evidence for why it works with interactive visualizations
- Provide copy-ready prompts for immediate adoption
- Present rigorous academic evidence while maintaining accessibility

## ✅ Implementation Progress

- ✅ Astro Paper setup with MDX and React
- ✅ Academic component library (Figure, Table, Equation, Sidenote)
- ✅ Typography system (Crimson Pro + Inter)
- ✅ VS Playground with 30 examples per task (expanded from 5)
- ✅ Math rendering (KaTeX) and citations (BibTeX)
- ✅ Initial blog post structure

### Week 2: Evidence & Interactivity

#### Days 1-2: Data Foundation (Complete)
- ✅ Chart infrastructure (Recharts + Framer Motion)
- ✅ Paper evidence data structure (all key findings)
- ✅ Typicality Bias Explainer (interactive ρ = 1 + ε/β)
- ✅ US States Demo (KL=0.12 distribution recovery)
- ✅ Post-Training Diversity Chart (66.8% retention)
- ✅ Diversity Gains Visualization (1.6-2.1× improvement)

#### Day 3: User Experience (Complete)
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality throughout
- ✅ Quick Start section (<30 seconds to try VS)
- ✅ Qualitative examples from Table 2
- ✅ PromptCard components for recipes
- ✅ CodeBlock with integrated copy buttons
- ✅ Documentation reorganization

#### Day 4: Critical Features (Complete)
- ✅ Temperature ablation interactive - Shows VS + temperature synergy
- ✅ Scaling trend visualization - Larger models benefit 1.5-2× more
- ✅ VS variants comparison table - Clear guidance on when to use each
- ✅ Training-free emphasis badges - No training/fine-tuning required
- ✅ "VS beats fine-tuned models" callout - GPT-4+VS matches Llama fine-tuned
- ✅ Comprehensive FAQ section - Addresses common questions

#### Day 5: Remaining Tasks
- ⏳ Dialogue simulation visualization
- ⏳ Open-ended QA metrics display
- ⏳ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Cross-browser testing
- ⏳ Accessibility audit

### Week 3: Polish & Testing (Upcoming)
- User testing with 5+ readers
- Performance optimization (<3s load time)
- SEO optimization
- Mobile experience refinement

### Week 4: Launch (Upcoming)
- Production deployment
- Social media assets
- Launch monitoring
- Follow-up content
